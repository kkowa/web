## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

This section describes how to set your local environments up.

### üèóÔ∏è Setup

Followings are **required**.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

  To configure other dependent services like database, we use Docker (mainly [**Docker Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)).

- **(A)** Developing With Development Container

  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

    Basically **VS Code Development Container** provides rich features such as git configuration and GPG sharing. But they sometimes require you to install some tools based on your device. Please check [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_sharing-git-credentials-with-your-container).

- **(B)** Developing Locally

  - [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)

    It is recommended to use separate environment for Node to prevent unexpected bugs.

  - [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

    This project uses Yarn as package manager.

After you installed all above, then follow next steps based on your choice (A, B):

#### **(A)** Developing With Development Container

We configured all basic tools to be installed inside devcontainer.

1. Install VS Code extension **Remote - Containers (by Microsoft)**.

1. Then, clone this repository and open in VS Code, select **Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container...** at command palette (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>).

1. Done. Container includes required tools such as **pre-commit**, so you are ready to code.

#### **(B)** Developing Locally

1. Run `make install`

1. Run `make init`

1. Done. all other configurations are on your own. Or, you can use existing docker compose file to create dependent services (but would require some configuration changes).

#### **(C)** Remote Environment: GitHub Codespace or GitPod

In consideration but not ready to adopt it yet.

### üíØ pre-commit

We are using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to check common lint errors and for code formatting. If you are using VSC devcontainer setup we prepared, no need to use and initialize pre-commit because it is all done automatically.

Otherwise, You should install and run `pre-commit install` (or `make init`).

### üêã Docker Compose

You can see composed environment at [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file. To say shortly, exposed services would be:

- **web** at port **3000**

You could access to web UI via browsers. If are using Docker based on VM (like **Docker ToolBox**), localhost won't work for you. Follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42886035).

### ‚å®Ô∏è Basic Commands

Check [package.json](./package.json) for common commands.

Convenience scripts are defined in [Makefile](./Makefile) at project root. `make` without arguments will show you possible commands.
